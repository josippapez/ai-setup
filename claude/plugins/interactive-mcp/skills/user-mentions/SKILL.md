description: Always re-open user-referenced files before updating code or generators.

# user-mentions

When a user points to specific files, instructions or skill, or says they updated them, re-read them (and their generator counterparts, if any) before making changes that affect those files.

## Best practices

- Open the mentioned files to mirror their current state; if generators mirror them, open the matching templates under tools/nx-plugin/ and update both.
- If a referenced file cannot be found, search the workspace or ask the user for the correct path before proceeding.
